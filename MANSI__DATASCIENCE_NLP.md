### DATA SCIENCE AND NLP :books: :books:
**With so much data available in today's time there is a need to process the data,clean it,analyse it and present it in an understandable format.The field of Data Science thus fascinates me.This field unifies statistics,data analysis,computing and related fields to provide an integrated method to understand data.**
**NLP which is a sub field of AI and is used in text and speech processing,morphological segmentations,syntactic analysis and many more areas is performed using various DEEP LEARNING models.NLP uses syntax to access meanings from a language based on grammatical rules.It uses algorithms to understand meaning and structure of sentences.**
